1. AWS Lambda as the Core Service

AWS Lambda is the backbone of the application’s backend, handling all server-side logic. Netlify Functions abstracts the AWS Lambda setup, allowing you to deploy functions as files in your Git repository. Each function is a self-contained unit of logic that processes specific tasks, such as handling user input or generating AI responses.





Use Case: The Lambda function processes incoming HTTP requests (e.g., a POST request with user input) and interacts with Amazon Bedrock to generate a response.



Netlify Integration: Netlify automatically deploys these functions as AWS Lambda functions, handling service discovery and scaling. You write the function code in a designated folder (e.g., functions/), and Netlify configures the underlying Lambda infrastructure.

2. API Gateway as a Lambda Trigger

Amazon API Gateway is used to create RESTful endpoints that trigger the Lambda functions. In a Netlify setup, the API Gateway is managed implicitly by Netlify’s function deployment process, but you can also configure a custom API Gateway in your AWS account for more control.





Setup: An API Gateway REST API is created with a resource (e.g., /generate) and a method (e.g., POST). This method is integrated with a Lambda function using Lambda Proxy Integration for simplicity.



CORS Handling: To avoid CORS issues, the API Gateway is configured with Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers, and Netlify’s deployment process simplifies this by enabling CORS automatically for functions.



Trigger: When the frontend sends a request to the API endpoint (e.g., https://<api-id>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/generate), API Gateway invokes the corresponding Lambda function.

3. Integration with Amazon Bedrock

Amazon Bedrock is integrated to provide generative AI capabilities, such as generating text based on user prompts. The Lambda function uses the AWS SDK (Boto3 for Python) to invoke a Bedrock model, such as Anthropic’s Claude.





Setup: In the AWS Console, access to a specific Bedrock model (e.g., anthropic.claude-v2) is enabled. The Lambda function’s IAM role is granted the bedrock:InvokeModel permission.



Process: The Lambda function receives user input (e.g., a text prompt) via the API Gateway, constructs a payload for Bedrock, and invokes the model. The response is processed and returned to the frontend.
